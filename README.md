Just messing with TeaVM

thanks to SquidDev's Copy Cat https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/copy-cat/blob/master/build.gradle.kts for some notes on the project structure, still lots to learn with gradle. I should prob delete the build/teavm-out directory before running teavmtool because old files can stick around in there
